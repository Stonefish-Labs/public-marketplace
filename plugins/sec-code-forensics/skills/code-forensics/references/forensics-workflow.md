# Forensics Workflow

## 1. Project Focus

- Determine primary objective and intended users.
- Summarize the software value proposition.

## 2. Functional Analysis

- Trace key logic flows and state transitions.
- Identify important data model and persistence paths.

## 3. Composition Analysis

- List runtimes, languages, frameworks, and dependencies.
- Document architecture shape and deployment/build surfaces.

## 4. Security Hotspots

- Authentication and authorization paths.
- User-input entry points and validation.
- Database and query construction.
- File handling and external service integrations.
- Sensitive data handling and secret management.

## 5. OWASP Mapping

Map findings to OWASP Top 10 (A01-A10) and include confidence.

## 6. Unanswered Questions

List ambiguities that require runtime access, tests, or stakeholder confirmation.

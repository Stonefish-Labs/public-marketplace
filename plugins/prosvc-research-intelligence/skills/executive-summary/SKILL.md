# Executive Summary

Use this skill for decision-focused summaries with deterministic sectioning and tight word limits.

## Quick Start

1. Confirm input document type, audience, and key decision required.
2. Apply section contract from `references/summary-structure.md`.
3. Enforce length and quantification constraints before final output.

## Mandatory Output Sections

1. Situation overview
2. Key findings
3. Business impact
4. Recommendations
5. Next steps

## Quality Rules

- Total length: 325-475 words, hard cap 500.
- Key findings: 3-5 insights, each with at least one quantified metric.
- Recommendations: owner, timeline, and expected outcome.

## When To Use

- User needs leadership-ready synthesis from larger source material.
- A concise strategic document is required for quick decision making.

## When Not To Use

- User needs detailed technical appendix instead of executive format.
- Source content is too thin to support quantified findings.

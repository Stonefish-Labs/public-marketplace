## Naming and Category Policy

- Plugin names use category-oriented prefixes (for example: `sys-macos-*`, `sys-win-*`, `agentic-dev-*`, `cloud-*`).
- Categories are single-purpose and fixed to this taxonomy: `meme`, `agentic-dev`, `dev`, `system-management-macos`, `system-management-windows`, `system-management-linux`, `security-privacy`, `webhooks`, `cloud`, `professional-services`, `legacy-journal`, `lifestyle`, `media-content`.
- Technology suffixes are normalized out of IDs where possible (`-mcp`, `-server`, `-plugin`).

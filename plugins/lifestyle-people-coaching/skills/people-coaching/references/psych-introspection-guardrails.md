# Psych Introspection Guardrails

These protocols are reflective tools, not therapy or diagnosis.

## Mandatory Intro Language

Use before proceeding:

"This process is for self-reflection only, not therapy, diagnosis, or crisis support. If this becomes overwhelming, we can stop immediately."

## Opt-In Checkpoint

Ask:

"Do you want to continue with a high-intensity introspection protocol, or switch to a lighter reflective mode?"

Proceed only on explicit opt-in.

## Stop Conditions

Stop and de-escalate if user reports:

- overwhelm, panic, distress escalation
- self-harm ideation
- inability to continue safely

## De-Escalation Response

- pause protocol immediately
- shift to grounding: simple present-focused prompts
- recommend qualified professional support for clinical concerns

## Hard Boundaries

- no diagnosis labels
- no certainty claims about trauma causes
- no coercive language
- no emergency-response role play

## Protocol Variants

See `psych-protocol.md` for prompt variants and stage structures.

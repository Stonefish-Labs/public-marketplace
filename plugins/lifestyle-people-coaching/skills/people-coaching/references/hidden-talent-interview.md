# Hidden Talent Interview Protocol

Goal: identify recurring natural-strength patterns from lived experience.

## Phases

1. Opening and early patterns (2-3 exchanges)
2. Childhood exploration (4-5 exchanges)
3. School/adolescent patterns (3-4 exchanges)
4. Current life patterns (3-4 exchanges)
5. Cross-pattern analysis (2-3 exchanges)
6. Synthesis and evidence-backed talent statement (1-2 exchanges)

## Rules

- Ask one focused question at a time.
- Request specific memories, not general summaries.
- Track these indicators:
  - ease of learning
  - natural helping/teaching behavior
  - time distortion/flow
- Challenge self-minimization gently with evidence.

## Output

- named talent hypothesis
- evidence snippets from user examples
- practical applications in work and personal contexts

The Maroons of Jamaica, who once sought refuge in the island's Blue Mountains, eternalized the Arawak's ancient jerk technique by spicing or seasoning the meat, wrapping it in leaves, then placing it on hot rocks over a lattice of wood. This technique evolved with the use of different spices to the cooking style that we know today as Jerk. At the Jerk Shack, chefs apply the jerk cooking style using a marinade or paste that incorporates pimento (allspice) and scotch bonnet peppers.",

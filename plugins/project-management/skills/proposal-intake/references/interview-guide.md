# Interview Push-Back Guide

Reference for handling weak answers during proposal intake. Read this when you need coaching on how to push back during each interview step.

## Step 1: Problem

Push-back triggers:
- If the answer starts with a solution ("I want to build X"), redirect: "That's a solution. What's the problem it solves?"
- If the answer is aspirational ("It would be nice to have..."), challenge: "'Nice to have' isn't a problem. What breaks without this? What are you putting up with right now?"
- If the answer is vague, ask for a specific recent example where this problem caused pain.

## Step 2: Desired Outcome

Push-back triggers:
- If the answer is abstract ("things would be better"), demand specifics: "Better how? What can you do after that you can't do now?"
- If there are no observable criteria, press for them: "How would you know you're done? What would you show someone?"

## Step 3: Why This, Why Now?

Push-back triggers:
- If the answer is excitement-driven ("I just think it would be really cool"), call it out: "Cool isn't a reason. What's the cost of not doing this for another 6 months?"
- If there's no time pressure, note it: "So there's no urgency. Why not let this sit and see if you still care in a month?"
- Reference the user's existing workload if visible: "You have N other things in flight. What makes this more important than finishing those?"

## Step 4: What If I Don't?

Push-back triggers:
- If the answer is "nothing, really" -- say so directly: "Then why are we talking about this? Shelf it. If it matters, it'll come back."
- If the answer is speculative ("well, eventually..."), challenge the timeline: "Eventually when? Is that a real deadline or a feeling?"

## Step 5: Rough Effort

Push-back triggers:
- If the user says Small but the scope sounds Large, say so: "You listed 5 things that need to happen and 3 open questions. That's not Small."
- If they can't estimate, that's fine -- capture what they'd need to know first, and note that the gate fails.

## Assessing Value and Importance

When helping the user think through why something matters (Steps 3-4 especially, or during any importance assessment), consider surfacing this filter:

**The Three-Way Test** (adapted from Tony Robbins):
- Is it good for **you**?
- Is it good for **others** (people you care about, collaborators, users)?
- Is it good for **the greater good** (community, society, the world at large)?

Projects that score on all three tend to sustain motivation and justify their slot. Projects that only serve one dimension -- especially just "good for me" -- deserve extra scrutiny on the "Why Now?" and "What If I Don't?" questions. This isn't a gate, just a useful lens to offer the user when they're struggling to articulate importance.

# Briefing Structure

Produce the briefing in this order. Skip sections that don't apply (e.g., no Milestones section for proposals).

## 1. Identity

- Project name and ID
- Current status and which folder it's in
- Group membership (if any)
- Tags

One or two lines. Just enough to confirm what we're looking at.

## 2. What Is This?

- For projects: Restate the Goal section in 1-2 sentences.
- For proposals: Restate the Problem section in 1-2 sentences.
- Include the Done When / Desired Outcome criteria.

The user should be able to read this and immediately remember what this project is about.

## 3. Key Dates

- Date created / date proposed
- Last updated (and how long ago that was from today)
- Date completed (if archived)
- Review by (if a proposal)

Flag staleness explicitly: "Last touched 47 days ago" is more useful than just the date.

## 4. Priority Context

For projects (not proposals):
- Importance level and the reason
- Urgency flag and the reason
- If urgent but stale, flag the contradiction.

## 5. Milestone Progress

For projects with milestones:
- Summary line: "4 of 7 milestones complete."
- List any milestones that are `in-progress`.
- List any milestones that are past their due date.
- Note the next pending milestone.

Don't dump the entire milestone table -- summarize it.

## 6. Recent Activity

Pull the last 3-5 work log entries (or fewer if the log is short). Summarize as bullet points. Focus on:
- Status changes
- Milestone completions
- Key decisions or blockers mentioned

If the most recent entry is old, say so: "Last activity was 2026-01-15 -- 38 days ago."

## 7. Open Questions

List any unresolved open questions from the project. Note which ones have been answered (dated sub-bullets) and which are still pending.

## 8. Things to Watch

Flag anything that needs attention:
- Overdue milestones
- Stale status (active but no work log entries in 30+ days)
- Projects in Paused/ -- why they were paused and how long they've been sitting
- Proposals approaching or past their `review_by` date
- Contradictions (e.g., marked active but last work was months ago)
- Missing information (empty sections, missing `importance_reason`, etc.)

If nothing stands out, say so: "Nothing flagged. Project looks current."

# Consultation Type Playbooks

Reference for structuring analysis based on the identified question type. Read the relevant section once you've framed the user's question in Step 1.

## Approach Selection / Trade-Off Analysis

- Present 2-4 concrete options. Not a wall of text -- a short label and 2-3 sentences per option.
- For each option, state: what it gets you, what it costs, and the main risk.
- If one option is clearly dominant, say so and explain why. Don't manufacture false balance.
- If the choice genuinely depends on the user's priorities, identify the pivot question: "This comes down to whether you care more about X or Y."

## Scope / Feasibility Check

- Identify the hard constraints (time, money, skills, dependencies).
- Flag anything that looks underestimated or hand-waved.
- If the scope is too big, suggest what to cut and why.
- Reference the project's milestones and effort estimates if available.

## Unblocking

- Diagnose the actual blocker. Often what the user says is the blocker and the real blocker are different things.
- Suggest the smallest next action that would create forward movement.
- If the blocker is external (waiting on someone, missing information), suggest how to work around it or what to do in the meantime.

## Prioritization

- Look at importance and urgency fields across the relevant projects.
- Identify dependencies -- does finishing A unblock B?
- Identify time-sensitivity -- does anything have a hard deadline or decay if delayed?
- Suggest an order with reasoning. Be opinionated.

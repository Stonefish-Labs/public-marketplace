More than a suite, these exceptional escapes are reminiscent of a casually elegant beach house. Chic, warm and stylish, sea-inspired decor brings the serenity of the outside in with natural wood finishes and subtle shades of sea glass. Upstairs is an open and airy living room complete with plush seating, a wall-mounted HD Smart television, fully stocked bar, and retractable glass doors that welcome the sunlight. The lower level showcases a spacious master bedroom with a king-size sleigh bed, HD Smart television, and glass doors that open up to a private balcony with an outdoor Tranquility Soaking Tub for two overlooking the beach. The en-suite bathroom is an escape within itself featuring a spa-style walk-in rain shower and long double vanity with backlit mirror. Here, you'll enjoy waking up to ocean panoramas each morning and the attentive service of a personal butler. Butler Elite and 24-hour in-room dining are included.3f3:{\"amenityId\":228,\"amenityName\":\"One-Bedroom Suite\",\"amenityType\":\"Room Types\",\"amenityCategory\":\"Room Types\"}",

# Pull Drop Mark Cheatsheet

Use this as the translation key when converting non-food inputs.

## Core Mapping

- Pull = primary components; "main protein" ideas; the big pieces that must be on the grill.
- Drop = base layer and quantity; where the order sits; pace/heat cues.
- Mark = details and modifiers; doneness, toppings, exceptions, special handling.

## Practical Heuristics

- If the input has 1-3 major nouns, they usually belong in Pull.
- If the input implies volume, complexity, or sequencing, express that in Drop.
- If the input includes constraints, preferences, or style, express those in Mark.
- If there are no obvious food equivalents, use metaphor and keep it coherent.

## Phrase Bank

- Pull: "Pull one...", "Pull two...", "Pull for a sandwich..."
- Drop: "Drop one scattered", "Drop two in the ring", "Drop one scattered well"
- Mark: "Mark all the way", "Mark hold the...", "Mark with..."

## Tone Boundaries

- Keep it ridiculous, not cruel.
- Avoid targeted insults or unsafe instructions.
- Keep output readable enough that someone could follow the joke.

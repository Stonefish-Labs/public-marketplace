# People Coaching

Use this skill for coaching and reflective conversations with structured prompt frameworks.

## Quick Start

1. Pick the track:
   - coaching conversation: `references/coaching-habit-seven-questions.md`
   - challenging prompt stress-test: `references/challenging-prompts-library.md`
   - hidden talent interview: `references/hidden-talent-interview.md`
   - deep introspection (guardrailed): `references/psych-introspection-guardrails.md`
2. Collect minimal context from the user.
3. Run one protocol at a time and summarize actionable takeaways.

## When To Use

- A manager wants structured coaching dialogue.
- A user wants candid challenge prompts to stress-test assumptions.
- A user wants a guided process for surfacing natural strengths.
- A user explicitly asks for introspective protocol work.

## When Not To Use

- The user is in crisis or requests clinical diagnosis.
- The user requests mental health treatment guidance.

## Psych/Introspection Safety Policy (Mandatory)

Before any psych-style protocol:

1. Show non-therapeutic disclaimer and boundaries.
2. Ask for opt-in confirmation.
3. Include stop conditions and de-escalation guidance.
4. Refuse diagnosis, emergency intervention, or certainty claims.

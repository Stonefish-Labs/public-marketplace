# Source Quality Checklist

Apply this checklist before final synthesis.

## Credibility

- Is the source primary, official, or otherwise authoritative?
- Is authorship clear and relevant to the subject?
- Is publication date suitable for the claim's stability?

## Evidence Integrity

- Does the source provide direct evidence or only opinion?
- Are key numbers and claims reproducible from cited material?
- Are there conflicts of interest that could bias claims?

## Coverage

- Do sources represent multiple perspectives?
- Are major opposing views represented fairly?
- Are known limitations and uncertainties documented?

## Traceability

- Every critical claim has at least one citation.
- High-impact claims have at least two independent sources when possible.
- Any inferred conclusion is labeled as inference.

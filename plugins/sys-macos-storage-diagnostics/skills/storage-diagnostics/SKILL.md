  Diagnose disk capacity and storage pressure on macOS, Linux, and Windows. Use
  this skill for prompts like "disk is full", "how much free space", "which
  partition is near capacity", or "show storage IO". This skill focuses only on
  partition usage and disk IO counters and avoids unrelated process, network, or
  environment data collection. It is the preferred skill for storage triage.

  Diagnose connected peripherals and monitor configuration on macOS, Linux, and
  Windows. Use this skill for prompts like "what USB devices are connected",
  "bluetooth pairing status", "which monitors are active", "resolution", or
  "refresh rate". This skill is scoped to device and display inventory only and
  avoids collecting process, port, storage, or external-network data.

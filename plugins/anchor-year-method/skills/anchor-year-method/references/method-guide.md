# Anchor Year Method Guide

The Anchor Year Method helps people recover autobiographical memory by focusing on one specific year and exploring linked context.

## Core Idea

Instead of trying to remember a whole life timeline all at once, choose one year and reconstruct:

1. The outside world
2. Your personal circumstances
3. Your interests and emotionally meaningful events
4. Connections to people, places, and artifacts

Memory is relational. One detail often unlocks many others.

## Canonical Sequence

1. **Select Anchor Year**
   - Arbitrary or meaningful year.
2. **Set World Context**
   - Major headlines
   - Music, movies, TV
   - Technology
   - Fashion and social vibe
3. **Build Personal Snapshot**
   - Age and location
   - School or work
   - Family dynamics
   - Typical daily rhythm
4. **Explore Passions And Events**
   - Hobbies, games, sports, media
   - Holidays, birthdays, milestones
5. **Consult Sources**
   - Ask family/friends what they remember
   - Review photos, journals, report cards, letters

## Memory Chain Example

Year -> Public event -> Personal desire -> Action taken -> Related people and places.

Concrete example:

- `1996`
- `Nintendo 64 release`
- `Hoping for one at Christmas`
- `Selling old console to grandparents`
- `Memories of grandparents, games, anticipation, holiday morning`

## Typical Applications

- Legacy journals
- Memoir drafting
- Personal history interviews
- Family memory projects
- Guided reflection exercises
